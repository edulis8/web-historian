> This sprint was part of my coursework at Hack Reactor Remote.

The sprint involved restling with and becoming more comfortable with Node.js development callback patterns, especially when chaining asynchronous functions

In this repository, I created multiple Node services, and relied on the command-line server process Cron to build a duplicate of the archive.org internet archiving website.

This app allows users to submit a URL, and it archives it (by getting a copy of that website off of the internet and writing it to a local text file), and shows users the archived copy.
