This sprint was part of my courseowork at Hack Reactor Remote.

The spring involved restling and becoming more comfortable with Node.js development callback patterns, especially when chaining asynchronous functions

In this repository, I created multiple Node services, and relied on the command-line server process Cron to build a duplicate of the archive.org internet archiving website.

A bare node server using the fs module to read and write from the file structure.

This app allows users to submit a URL, and it archives it (by getting a copy of that website off of the internet and writing it to a local text file), and shows users the archived copy.
