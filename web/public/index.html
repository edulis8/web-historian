<!-- Ask for google.com
google.com gets POSTED to server
server check if google.com has been archived
  if not, the server will download it AND serve up the loading.html page

  loading.html - should it automatically try to GET that same page?
  Or should the user just have to go back to index html and try again?


now that is has been archived
user asks for google.com
  server checks list, sees that its there
    servers the saved /google.com -->
